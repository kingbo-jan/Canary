# 🐤 Canary

## About the Name
> Just as canaries were used in coal mines to detect dangerous gases before they could harm miners, Canary serves as an early warning system for digital threats. In the 19th century, these birds were exceptional risk predictors due to their sensitivity to carbon monoxide, helping prevent numerous mining incidents during industrialization.

## The Vision Behind Canary
> "It's really all about putting people at the forefront when we are designing and implementing security"
> 
> — Julie Haney, HCC program lead at NIST

### Why I Created This Tool
As someone transitioning into tech, I experienced firsthand how overwhelming cybersecurity tools can be. The existing security landscape presents two major challenges:

1. **Technical Complexity**: Most security tools are designed for industry professionals, making them inaccessible to everyday users.

2. **User Accessibility Gap**: While everyday users are most vulnerable to cyber attacks, they lack access to user-friendly security tools.

### The Solution
Canary bridges this gap by:
- Maintaining industry-standard security measures
- Presenting them in an accessible, user-friendly interface
- Focusing on human-centered cybersecurity design
- Making protection automatic and intuitive

### Mission
Our mission is to democratize cybersecurity by creating tools that are:
- Non-technical-user-friendly
- Industry-standard compliant
- Easy to configure
- Simple to use
- Effective in protecting users
