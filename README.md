# Canary

> Just as canaries were used in coal mines to detect dangerous gases before they could harm miners, Canary serves as an early warning system for digital threats. In the 19th century, these birds were exceptional risk predictors due to their sensitivity to carbon monoxide, helping prevent numerous mining incidents during industrialization.

## What is Canary?
Canary is a cybersecurity tool that emphasizes human-centered security designs. It focuses on gamified learning and user-friendly solutions to help everyday users protect themselves from various cyber threats and scams that they are unfamiliar with. It leverages smart AI Assistants to help proactively analyze and cross reference the web as the user is using it and warns them against potential threats. 

I believe that humans should be at the forefront of security designs rather than as an afterthought, so let us all be informed and stay safe together. 

### Key Features:

#### 1. Community Security Platform (MVP)
> Creating a local threat visualization so that users in a community (such as in apartment communities) can stay up to date with potential threats and vulnerabilities
> user education systems
> community alert systems

#### 2. 🛡️ Phishing Detection Tool 
Our feature leverages industry-standard threat detection capabilities with a user-friendly approach:
- Automatic browser monitoring
- Real-time threat detection  
- Cross-referencing with multiple security databases
- Instant user notifications for suspicious links

#### What Sets This Tool Apart?
Unlike traditional tools such as WOT, PhishTank, and VirusTotal that require manual URL submission, Canary:
- Automatically scans as users browse
- Provides real-time protection
- Offers clear context and education on potential phishing techniques
- AI Assists with actionable warnings to guide the users' next steps
- Integrates seamlessly with daily browsing

## The Vision Behind Canary
> "It's really all about putting people at the forefront when we are designing and implementing security"

### Why I Created This Tool
As someone transitioning into tech, I experienced firsthand how overwhelming cybersecurity tools can be. The existing security landscape presents two major challenges:

1. **Technical Complexity**: Most security tools are designed for industry professionals, making them inaccessible and harder to navigate for everyday users.

2. **User Accessibility Gap**: While everyday users are most vulnerable to cyber attacks, they lack access to user-friendly security tools to protect themselves.

### The Solution
Canary bridges this gap by:
- Maintaining industry-standard security measures
- Presenting them in an accessible, user-friendly interface
- Focusing on human-centered cybersecurity design
- Making protection automatic and intuitive

### Mission
Our mission is to democratize cybersecurity by creating tools that are:
- Non-technical-user-friendly
- Industry-standard compliant
- Easy to configure
- Simple to use
- Effective in protecting and educating users
